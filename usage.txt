TL;DR

For decent NV cards:
 - edit webui/.env and set COMMANDLINE_ARGS="--listen --enable-insecure-extension-access --xformers"
 - run "docker compose up"

For older NV cards that has about 6G vram:
 - edit webui/.env and set COMMANDLINE_ARGS="--listen -medvram --enable-insecure-extension-access --xformers"
 - run "docker compose up"

=======
Usage:

1. Customize webui/.env and docker-compose.yml to fit your need.
2. Build image with "docker compose build".
3. Start the service with "docker compose up -d", it will take some time to
   install dependencies.

To configure accelerater or install dependencies manually, you'll need a
venv-ready shell by running "docker compose run --rm webui bash".
